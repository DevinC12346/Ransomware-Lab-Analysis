## Ransomware-Lab-Analysis - Devin Cox


# Objective 
 analyze a memory dump to identify indicators of ransomware activity. This includes locating malicious processes, identifying encryption patterns and tracing execution paths using Volatility3 in linux.

 # Skills Learned 
- Using Volatility 3 to analyze memory dumps
- Identifying malicious processes and hidden artifacts
- Tracing parent-child relationships with pstree
- Detecting injected or unlinked processes using psscan
- Analyzing ransomware execution patterns and memory artifacts

 # Write-Up

 I began the lab by cloning the Volatility 3 repository from GitHub using the git clone commmand "git clone https: //github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility3.git". Next, I installed the necessary dependencies with the sudo apt install command. I verified the installation by running "vol.py -h" to confirm the tool was set up correctly.

Next, I executed the command python3 vol.py -f infected.vmem windows.psscan to perform a raw memory scan for hidden or unlinked processes. This approach allows for the identification of terminated or rootkit-masked processes that may not appear in the active process list.

 After looking through the psscan, I put the results into a notepad file and I located the suspiscous process called "@WannaDecryptor" with the PPID of 2732

Next, I executed a PsTree scan to analyze the parent-child process hierarchy and identify the executable associated with the Parent Process ID (PPID) 2732. I exported the results to a text file for further examination and utilized the CTRL-F search function to quickly locate entries linked to this PPID. This analysis revealed an executable named "or4qtckT.exe", indicating a potentially suspicious process.

After finding the executable file I used the grep command on the PID, "2732" to check if it was linked to any other processe. The results of the command displayed a third process called taskdl.exe

Next, I performed a memory dump of the executable associated with PID 2732 using the following command: "python3 vol.py -f infected.vmem windows.psscan --pid 2732 --dump". This operation extracted the process memory and generated an output file named "2732.or4qtckT.exe.0x400000.dmp", allowing for further analysis of the executableâ€™s contents.
